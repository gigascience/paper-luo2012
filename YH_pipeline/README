Run "run_1.0.sh" "run_2.0.sh" "run_sparse.sh" and "run_sparse_muti_test.sh" in "YH_pipleline" directory to get assemblies using SOAPdenovo1 SOAPdenovo2 SOAPdenovo2_sparse and SOAPdenovo2_sparse_multi. However, to have the pipeline run correctly, we suggest reading the whole README before running it.

There are 9 steps for YH assembly. These steps are:
0) download file
1) filter low quality data
2) build kmer frequency table
3) correct errors
4) run "pregraph" or "all"
5) run "contig"
6) run "map"
7) run "scaff"
8) fill gaps
You can decide which steps are going to be run by setting "start" and "stop" options in "run.sh".

If you have already downloaded data before, there is no need to download it again. Instead, you need to:
1) Create directories "SOAPdenovo1/data" under "YH_pipleline" directory.
2) Link or copy your downloaded data to "SOAPdenovo1/data".
Then you can start the pipeline from step 1 by setting "start" to 1 in "run_2.0.sh".
3) Create a directory "SOAPdenovo2/data" under "YH_pipleline" directory.
4) Link those files in "YH_pipleline/SOAPdenovo1/data" directory to "YH_pipleline/SOAPdenovo2/data" directory.
Then you can start the pipeline from step 1 by setting "start" to 1 in "run_2.0.sh".
5) Create a directory "assembly_sparse/data" under "YH_pipleline" directory.
6) Link those files in "YH_pipleline/SOAPdenovo1/data" directory to "YH_pipleline/assembly_sparse/data" directory.
Then you can start the pipeline from step 1 by setting "start" to 1 in "run_sparse.sh".
7) Create a directory "SOAPdenovo2/data" under "Assemblathon1_pipleline" directory.
8) Link those files in "YH_pipleline/SOAPdenovo1/data" directory to "YH_pipleline/assembly_sparse_muti_test/data" directory.
Then you can start the pipeline from step 1 by setting "start" to 1 in "run_sparse_muti_test.sh".

If the pipeline terminates unexpectly, you can restart it from the failed step by changing the "start" to the failed step in "run.sh".

The final scaffold file of SOAPdenovo1 pipeline is under "SOAPdenovo1/gapcloser" directory, named as "asm_31.scafSeq.GC". And the final scaffold file of SOAPdenvo2 pipeline is under "SOAPdenovo2/gapcloser" directory, named as "asm_45.scafSeq.GC". And final scaffold file of SOAPdenvo2_sparse pipeline is under "assembly_sparse/gapcloser" directory, named as "asm_35.scafSeq.GC".And final scaffold file of SOAPdenvo2 pipeline is under "assembly_sparse_muti_test/gapcloser" directory, named as "asm_35.scafSeq.GC".
